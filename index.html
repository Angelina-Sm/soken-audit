                This is a comprehensive report based on our automated and manual examination of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and framework flaws. We took into consideration smart contract based algorithms, as well.  Reading the full analysis report is essential to build your understanding of project’s security level. It is crucial to take note, though we have done our best to perform this analysis and report, that you should not rely on the our research and cannot claim what it states or how we created it. Before making any judgments, you have to conduct your own independent research.  We will discuss this in more depth in the following disclaimer - please read it fully.

        <section class="Procedure">
            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <h3>Our analysis contains following steps:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Project Analysis;</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>Manual analysis of smart contracts: 
                        <li>Deploying smart contracts on any of the network(Ropsten/Rinkeby) using Remix IDE</li>
                        <li>Hashes of all transaction will be recorded</li>
                        <li>Behaviour of functions and gas consumption is noted, as well.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>Unit Testing:
                        <li>Smart contract functions will be unit tested on multiple parameters and under multiple conditions to ensure that all paths of functions are functioning as intended. </li>
                        <li>In this phase intended behaviour of smart contract is verified.</li>
                        <li>In this phase, we would also ensure that smart contract functions are not consuming unnecessary gas.</li>
                        <li>Gas limits of functions will be verified in this stage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>Automated Testing:
                        <li>Mythril</li>
                        <li>Oyente</li>
                        <li>Manticore</li>
                        <li>Solgraph</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <h3>We categorize the finding into 4 categories based on their vulnerability:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Low-severity issue — less important, must be analyzed</li>
                <li>Medium-severity issue — important, needs to be analyzed and fixed</li>
                <li>High-severity issue —important, might cause vulnerabilities, must be analyzed and fixed</li>
                <li>Critical-severity issue —serious bug causes, must be analyzed and fixed.</li>
            </ul>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>The security audit of Smart Contract cannot cover all vulnerabilities. Even if no vulnerabilities are detected in the audit, there is no guarantee that future smart contracts are safe. Smart contracts are in most cases safeguarded against specific sorts of attacks. In order to find as many flaws as possible, we carried out a comprehensive smart contract audit. Audit is a document that is not legally binding and guarantees nothing. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Basic Security Recommendation</h2>
            <p>Unlike hardware and paper wallets, hot wallets are connected to the internet and store private keys online, which exposes them to greater risk. If a company or an individual holds significant amounts of cryptocurrency in a hot wallet, they should consider using MultiSig addresses. Wallet security is enhanced when private keys are stored in different locations and are not controlled by a single entity. </p>

            <h2>Security Issues</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    <h3>Volatile Code:</h3>
                    <p>The return values of functions swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens and addLiquidityETH are not properly handled. </p>
                    <h3>Recommendation:</h3>
                    <p>We recommend using variables to receive the return value of the functions mentioned above and handle both success and failure cases if needed by the business logic.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Out of Gas issue:</h3>
                    <img src="./images/Gas-issue.png" alt="">
                    <p>The function includeInRewards() uses the loop to find and remove
                        addresses from the _excluded list. Function will be aborted with
                        OUT_OF_GAS exception if there will be a long excluded addresses list.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Out of Gas issue:</h3>
                    <img src="./images/Gas-ssue2.png" alt="">
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The function _getCurrentSupply also uses the loop for evaluating total
                supply. It also could be aborted with OUT_OF_GAS exception if there
                will be a long excluded addresses list.
            </p>
            <h3>Recommendation: </h3>
            <p>Use EnumerableSet instead of array or do not use long arrays.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Low-severity issues exist within smart contracts. Smart contracts are free from any critical or high-severity issues.</p>
            <p>NOTE: Please check the disclaimer above and note, that audit makes no statements or warranties on business model, investment attractiveness or code sustainability. </p>
